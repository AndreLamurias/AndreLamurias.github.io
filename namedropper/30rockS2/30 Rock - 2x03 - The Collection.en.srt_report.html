He led the 1980s federal prosecution of New York City mafia bosses, and led the city&#x27;s civic cleanup as its mayor from 1994 to 2001. In 2017, US President Donald Trump appointed him cybersecurity advisor. In 2018, he joined Trump&#x27;s personal legal team. Politically a Democrat and then Independent in the 1970s, Giuliani has been a Republican since the 1980s. The US Associate Attorney General from 1981 to 1983, he was the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York from 1983 to 1989. After a failed New York City Mayoral election campaign in 1989, he succeeded in 1993, and was reelected in 1997, holding a platform of toughness on crime.Mayor Giuliani appointed as New York City&#x27;s new police commissioner an outsider, William Bratton. Reforming the police department&#x27;s administration and policing practices, they applied the broken windows theory, which cites social disorder, like disrepair and vandalism, for attracting loitering addicts, panhandlers, and prostitutes, followed by serious and violent criminals. In particular, Giuliani focused on removing panhandlers and sex clubs from Times Square, promoting a &quot;family values&quot; vibe and a return to the area’s earlier focus on business, theater, and the arts. As crime rates fell steeply, well ahead of the national average pace, Giuliani was widely credited, yet later critics cite other, contributing factors. In 2000, he ran against Senator Hillary Clinton for a US Senate seat from New York, but left the race once diagnosed with prostate cancer. Still, for his mayoral leadership upon the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001, he was called &quot;America&#x27;s mayor.&quot; Also named Time magazine&#x27;s Person of the Year 2001, he was knighted in 2002 by Elizabeth II, the queen of the United Kingdom.In 2002, Giuliani founded a security consulting business, Giuliani Partners, and acquired, but later sold, an investment banking firm, Giuliani Capital Advisors. In 2005, he joined a law firm, renamed Bracewell &amp; Giuliani. Vying for the Republican Party&#x27;s 2008 presidential nomination, Giuliani was an early frontrunner, yet did poorly in the primary election, withdrew, and endorsed the party&#x27;s subsequent nominee, John McCain. Declining to run for New York governor in 2010 and for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012, Giuliani focused on the activities of his business firms. In addition, he has often been called on for public speaking, political commentary, and Republican campaign support. In April 2018 he joined President Donald Trump&#x27;s legal team. His activities as Trump&#x27;s attorney have returned Giuliani to media scrutiny, including allegations of corruption and profiteering. In late 2019, Giuliani was reportedly under federal investigation for violating lobbying laws, and possibly several other  charges, as a central figure in the Trump–Ukraine scandal, which resulted in the impeachment of Trump.

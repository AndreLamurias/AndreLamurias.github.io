Kennedy. During her lifetime, Jacqueline Kennedy was regarded as an international fashion icon. Her ensemble of a pink Chanel suit and matching pillbox hat that she wore in Dallas, Texas, when the president was assassinated on November 22, 1963, has become a symbol of her husband&#x27;s death. Even after her death, she ranks as one of the most popular and recognizable First Ladies in American history, and in 1999, she was listed as one of Gallup&#x27;s Most-Admired Men and Women of the 20th century.Kennedy was born in 1929 in Southampton, New York, to Wall Street stockbroker John Vernou Bouvier III and his wife, Janet Lee Bouvier. In 1951, she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in French literature from George Washington University and worked for the Washington Times-Herald as an inquiring photographer. The following year, she met then-Congressman John Kennedy at a dinner party in Washington. He was elected to the Senate that same year, and the couple married on September 12, 1953, in Newport, Rhode Island. They had four children, two of whom died in infancy. Following her husband&#x27;s election to the presidency in 1960, Jacqueline was known for her highly publicized restoration of the White House and emphasis on arts and culture, as well as for her style. At age 31, she was the third-youngest First Lady of the United States when her husband was inaugurated President.
After the assassination and funeral of her husband, Jacqueline Kennedy and her children largely withdrew from public view. In 1968, she married Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis. Following Onassis&#x27;s death in 1975, she had a career as a book editor in New York City. She died of a non-Hodgkin lymphoma in 1994.</td><td><ul><li>30 Rock - 2x15 - Cooter.HDTV.LOL.en.srt.jsonl</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Jackie</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Gerd Hornberger</td><td>8015678</td><td>0.3333333432674408</td><td>Gerd Hornberger (February 17, 1910 – September 13, 1988) was a German athlete who competed mainly in the 100 metres.

Her father ascended the throne on the abdication of his brother King Edward VIII in 1936, from which time she was the heir presumptive. She was educated privately at home and began to undertake public duties during the Second World War, serving in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. In 1947, she married Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, a former prince of Greece and Denmark, with whom she has four children: Charles, Prince of Wales; Anne, Princess Royal; Prince Andrew, Duke of York; and Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex.
When her father died in February 1952, Elizabeth became head of the Commonwealth and queen regnant of seven independent Commonwealth countries: the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Pakistan, and Ceylon. She has reigned as a constitutional monarch through major political changes, such as devolution in the United Kingdom, accession of the United Kingdom to the European Communities, Brexit, Canadian patriation, and the decolonisation of Africa. Between 1956 and 1992, the number of her realms varied as territories gained independence, and as realms, including South Africa, Pakistan, and Ceylon (renamed Sri Lanka), became republics. Her many historic visits and meetings include a state visit to the Republic of Ireland and visits to or from five popes. Significant events have included her coronation in 1953 and the celebrations of her Silver, Golden, and Diamond Jubilees in 1977, 2002, and 2012, respectively. In 2017, she became the first British monarch to reach a Sapphire Jubilee. She is the longest-lived and longest-reigning British monarch. She is the longest-serving female head of state in world history, and the world&#x27;s oldest living monarch, longest-reigning current monarch, and oldest and longest-serving current head of state.
Elizabeth has occasionally faced republican sentiments and press criticism of the royal family, in particular after the breakdown of her children&#x27;s marriages, her annus horribilis in 1992, and the death in 1997 of her former daughter-in-law Diana, Princess of Wales. However, in the United Kingdom, support for the monarchy has been and remains consistently high, as does her personal popularity.</td><td><ul><li>30 Rock - 2x15 - Cooter.HDTV.LOL.en.srt.jsonl</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Elizabeth</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Melinda Gates</td><td>51725</td><td>0.11473561823368073</td><td>Melinda Ann Gates (née French; August 15, 1964) is an American philanthropist and a former general manager at Microsoft.
